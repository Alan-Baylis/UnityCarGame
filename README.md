# UnityCarGame
After working a with Unity, I decided to try to create a car game on a terrain with mountains, sand, grass, trees and other neat features. I have learned how to build to iOS/Android. I currently control it with a joystick but I am working on how to control it with the Accelerometer for mobile device motion detection.

A picture of my car on my iPhone 7 can be viewed on my website: terpconnect.umd.edu/~ybencheq
